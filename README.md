Virtual Internship

Welcome to my GitHub repository! During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a project focusing on paying tribute to a role model using HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid. This project allowed me to delve into front-end web development techniques, honing my skills in structuring content, styling elements, and utilizing CSS Grid for layout design. Through this experience, I gained valuable hands-on experience in building visually appealing and responsive web pages while paying homage to influential figures. Explore the code to see how I integrated these technologies to create an engaging tribute platform.
